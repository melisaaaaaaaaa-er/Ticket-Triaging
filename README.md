# Ticket Triaging

<h3>Purpose</h3>

- Triage the previously created sample tickets on osTicket.

NOTE: agents cannot access tickets outside of their respective department, even if the agent is an administrator/has full access on the system. If you want an agent to have access to all tickets on the system, you will need to configure Extended Access for that agent.

Here are the tickets previously generated. This part of the lab involves triaging – evaluating and categorizing ticket severity and changing it accordingly, as well as assigning the appropriate SLA and department/team/agent that will handle the ticket.
